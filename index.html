                            <p>
                                Hi, I'm Sawyer.  I'm an iOS developer at Eventbase.  I currently mainly
                                work on the Eventbase iOS platform, building new functionality and improving the existing
                                codebase.  Before I started working full time, I was a student at the University 
                                of British Columbia majoring in business and computer science.
                                <br/><br/>
                                In my previous life, I was defined by the sport of rowing.  My story as a
                                high-performance athlete began as an eighth grader.  It came to an end when I
                                crossed the finish line in my last University race at the end of March 2019.  Over
                                the course of those ten years, I fell in love with the sport,
                                made friends for life, and won multiple national championships.
                                More importantly, I learned how to push myself to my breaking point, and then push 
                                a little bit further.
                                <br/><br/>
                                The lessons I learned through my rowing career colour how I approach every challenge 
                                I face.  I believe in making ideas a reality, working to achieve goals, and using 
                                every possible opportunity to improve.  My attitude has allowed me to build leadership, 
                                communication, and problem-solving skills in projects that I have been involved in 
                                personally and professionally.  Like I did in my rowing 
                                career, I want to work hard every single day, build relationships, and win.
                            </p>

                                <h3> Personal App </h3>
                                <h6> May 2018 </h6>
                                <p class="proj-details-small">
                                   I started this project to prepare for my work at Zenxmed.  I had done some iOS development
                                   for school projects before, but I felt like I needed a refresher and needed to improve
                                   so that I could be productive.  
                                <br><br>
                                   Originally, I used the app to keep reminders, notes, and recipes.  As time went on and I wanted
                                   to learn new things, I iterated on its design for a while.  One addition was making use of 
                                   local notifications and recurring notifications as a way to make the reminders functionality 
                                   more useful.  I started to invest money into the stock market, so I decided to implement an
                                   overview of my portfolio, getting real-time summaries of my investments.
                                <br><br>
                                   Although I no longer use the app since better tools exist for all of the things it could do,
                                   it was useful in teaching me the basics of iOS development and helping me discover a passion.
                                   Because of that, this will always be one of my favourite projects.

                                    worked with a partner to create a middle layer of a database - inputs were 
                                    users' queries, and outputs were tuples, stats, or other information that had 
                                    been requested.  To process information concurrently, we used promises.  We also 
                                    used REST endpoints to separate client and server.  In order to efficiently 
                                    transform, locate, and retrieve data, we used hash functions.  Testing was done 
                                    with Mocha and Chai.  Collaboration was done using GitHub.  My partner and I

                                    Completed as the final project for my Software Construction (CPSC 210) class.  
                                    The project was to create an Android app in Java that provided bus route 
                                    information around Vancouver.  I used TransLink's Open API to retrieve bus 
                                    route, stop, and schedule information, and built JSON parsers to interpret that 
                                    data.  By using the singleton design pattern, I was able to ensure that bus 
                                    stops and routes were accessible throughout the entire application.  When 
                                    clicking on a bus stop, users were shown bus routes overlaid on the map.  If 
                                    they wanted more information, they could click a button to get real-time 
                                    information on arrival times and delays.  Testing was done with JUnit and I 
                                    simulated the app's display using Genymotion.  I received a grade of 100% on the 
                                    project.

                                    I was inspired to create this project after learning about the method of loci, 
                                    which is a memory technique that uses visualization as a memory aid.  The method 
                                    of loci involves a user creating a "mind palace" - a route of a real-world 
                                    location that they are familiar with.  The idea behind the project was to 
                                    simplify the process of committing a mind palace to memory.  Users take pictures 
                                    that serve as the points on the route.  Along that route, users can insert 
                                    visual cues to help them remember something, from grocery lists to key points in 
                                    a presentation.  I decided to try to create a sense of augmented reality through 
                                    the use of emojis and functionality heavily inspired by Snapchat's stickers.

                                    While I was studying for my Artificial Intelligence (CPSC 322) final exam, I 
                                    decided to get some more hands-on experience with AI.  I created an AI to play 
                                    Frogger.  I originally used a simple neural network, a basic genetic algorithm, 
                                    and a fitness function based solely on distance travelled.  After many 
                                    iterations, I came up with a better fitness function and integrated the NEAT 
                                    algorithm into the selection and reproduction process.  I'm really happy with how
                                    it turned out, but it stagnated and was never able to consistently beat the game.

                                   I named this project after the Cambrian Explosion.  Creatures went through an
                                    evolution simulator where the individuals who ate the most food had a higher 
                                    chance of passing on their genes.  Through random mutation and natural 
                                    selection, creatures evolved through asexual reproduction.  I based the world on
                                    the cell stage from the Spore video game.  Over time, they began to have different
                                    body parts and different 
                                    connections in their "brains" (neural networks), which affected their behaviour.
                                    <br><br>
                                    By the end of the simulation, I had some pretty goofy looking creatures
                                    and they all had their own niches, which was pretty cool to see.  Some creatures
                                    played it safe, staying towards the edges where it was safer with less competition,
                                    but also less food.  Others evolved to be very small but fast, getting to food
                                    more quickly than their larger counterparts.  There were also large creatures who hunted
                                    smaller creatures, putting themselves at risk but with the potential for huge
                                    rewards.

                                    Admittedly, the project was much too ambitious for my understanding of AI.  I think
                                    it was the coolest project I've done, but there were a lot of bugs that I didn't have
                                    the knowledge to tackle on my own.  I should have let all the creatures bodies be the same
                                    and focus on the AI's evolution rather than trying to simulate learning at the same time
                                    as I was simulating physical evolution in order to keep it simple.  The biggest problem was that I couldn't come up with
                                    a fitness function that captured everything I wanted to, and the creatures evolved at a rate
                                    where one creature getting lucky would cause its descendents to crowd out creatures who were
                                    more legitimately intelligent.  I've thought about coming back to this project at a later date and simplifying it
                                    using an existing AI library rather than trying to build my own, but for now, I'm decently happy with it overall.

                                There are a lot of people think that sports are just something fun to do after school,
                                and for most people that's true.  For me, that's how it started.  But it turned into a
                                series of wins and losses that shapes the person I am today.  Admittedly, this story is much too
                                long for a site like this, but I feel like it's significant.  If you want to learn
                                who I really am and who I strive to be, this part of my life is more relevant than any resume I could write.

                                My rowing story began in <a class="rowingShowPic" onclick="showPic(1)">grade 
                                eight</a>.  I had just started high school at Vancouver College and joined the team 
                                mostly to make friends.  That decision turned out to be one of the best decisions I 
                                have ever made, and it changed my life forever.  
                                <br><br>

                                Through rowing, I learned to work hard.  I also learned how to be a good teammate.  
                                Rowing is unique in its team structure, since each person in the boat must perform 
                                the same precise motions in unison, and a mistake from one rower will affect the 
                                entire crew.  Everyone is responsible for themselves, and there needs to be a tremendous amount 
                                of trust between teammates.  I think about this a lot as it relates to the work I do now.
                                Development is a mostly solitary task.  You can be a part of a team, but everyone has their own
                                job in order to contribute to a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.

                                heavyweight 4+ event.  As sweet as 
                                <a class="rowingShowPic" onclick="showPic(2)">becoming a national champion</a> was, 
                                I learned more from my disappointing fourth place finish in my other race.  From that
                                time on, I started to live by a philosophy of getting 1% better every day.  It paid off the following 
                                year, when I won another national championship, this time on the senior level.

                                After <a class="rowingShowPic" onclick="showPic(3)">losing a close race</a> at 
                                nationals the next year, I came to UBC.  It was a totally different league.  I had 
                                been in the varsity boat for my entire high school experience, and I was relegated 
                                to the JV boat for the first time in my life.  It was the first time I had questioned 
                                whether I was good enough to be a university athlete.  I thought about leaving the team, but in 
                                the end, it came back to the 1% better philosophy.  The only way I would allow myself to 
                                quit was if I proved to myself that I wasn't good enough.  If I did everything right and still
                                couldn't make it, I would accept that it was time to move on.  I took my
                                training to an even higher level and was able to make the varsity lightweight 4+ in 
                                my second year, culminating in a second place finish at nationals.  The drive to 
                                win the gold medal motivated me through the rest of my rowing career.  <br><br>

                                The summer after my fourth year, I got the opportunity to compete in the 
                                <a class="rowingShowPic" onclick="showVid()">Windermere Cup</a> in Seattle and 
                                the <a class="rowingShowPic" onclick="showPic(6)">Vanke

                                in China.  Both races were watched by thousands of people and featured some of the 
                                best rowing schools in the world - Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge, Sidney, Brookes, the 
                                University of Washington, and others.  My crew placed second at Windermere and 
                                first in China. <br><br>

                                I took on more of a leadership role in my fifth year.  As the oldest and most 
                                experienced rower in the lightweight 4+, I was voted captain.  I had a 
                                young crew and understood that we needed to put in extra effort to beat Queens, 
                                who had two members of the national team in their boat.  We took extra training 
                                camps in Bellingham on top of our already rigorous schedule.  It was because of our 
                                teamwork and trust in one another that we were able to have the race of our lives.  
                                We were able to overcome Queens to win the <a class="rowingShowPic"

                                I learned a lot in ten years of rowing.  The most valuable thing that it gave me was a vision
                                of what I can make my professional career.  I want to be pushed, I want to win, and I
                                want to experience losses that drive me to get even better.  I want to be a teammate that always
                                takes responsibility, lifts people up, and eventually becomes a leader.  For me, rowing was not
                                just a sport.  It was a microchasm for the life I want to live.

                                Going into university, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do yet.  I chose to study 
                                commerce, since I felt that having business knowledge would be useful no matter 
                                where I chose to go in my career.  I was mostly uninspired by marketing, 
                                accounting, and many other common majors. <br><br>

                                In my second year, though, I took a class called Management Information Systems.  
                                It changed my life.  I learned very basic coding, and I was hooked.  After that, I 
                                knew that I wanted to go into a field where I could combine my business knowledge 
                                with technology.  I chose to major in Business and Computer Science, a combined 
                                major at UBC. <br><br>

                                I was inspired by learning the kinds of solutions that technology provides - 
                                working on technology that helps people reach their goals is where I 
                                have found my passion.

                                    My journey as a fan
                                </h4>

                            </div>


                            <p>
                                I enjoy watching basketball because each team has a unique style.  The 
                                Spurs' offense looks completely different from the analytic-driven "3s and 
                                layups" philosophy of the Warriors and Rockets.  The style that appealed the most to 
                                me was the Cavaliers' clear division of roles among its players - on every 
                                possession, it was one player's job to probe the defense, while others would cut, 
                                screen, provide spacing from the 3 point line, or prepare to get an offensive 
                                rebound.  Dividing these responsibilities made each player's job simpler and allowed
                                everyone to thrive in their roles, and the team became better than the sum of its
                                parts.  <br><br>

                                The struggles and 20-win seasons in my early days as a Cavaliers fan only made the 2016 
                                championship that much sweeter.  The Cavs had been down three games to one, and no 
                                one expected them to have a chance.  No team had ever come back from a 3-1 defecit 
                                in the NBA Finals.  They fought every game and were able to force a seventh game.  
                                After trailing in the second half, they tied the game at 89.  No one could score 
                                for what felt like an eternity until Kyrie Irving hit an unbelievable shot, 
                                completing the comeback.  In my own life, I try to replicate that team's demeanor,
                                perseverance, and confidence whenever I face a difficult challenge.
