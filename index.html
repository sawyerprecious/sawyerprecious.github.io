                            <p>
                                Hi, I'm Sawyer.  I'm a student at the University of British Columbia majoring in
                                both business and computer science.  Pursuing the BUCS program has allowed me to
                                expand my knowledge in two areas that I'm passionate about.  I've had the
                                opportunity to improve my coding skills as well as gain an understanding of how
                                successful organizations operate.  Going to UBC has also allowed me to continue
                                my rowing career.
                                <br/><br/>
                                For the past 10 years, I have been defined by the sport of rowing.  My story as a
                                high-performance athlete began as an eighth grader.  It came to an end when I
                                crossed the finish line in my last race at the end of March.  In between, I fell in
                                love with the sport, made friends for life, and won multiple national championships.
                                More importantly, I learned how to push myself to my breaking point, and then push 
                                just a little bit further.  I learned to be the kid who needed to prove that he 
                                belonged.  I learned how to be the leader who gave his teammates a pat on the back 
                                or a kick in the butt when they needed it.  I learned the glory of victory and the 
                                pain of defeat.  Rowing taught me how to succeed both on and off the water.
                                <br/><br/>
                                These lessons colour how I approach my academic and professional life.  I believe in 
                                making ideas a reality, working to achieve goals, and using every possible 
                                opportunity to improve.  My attitude has allowed me to build leadership, 
                                communication, and problem-solving skills in projects that I have been involved in 
                                both in and outside of school.  My main goal in life is to find the areas that I am 
                                the most skilled in and leverage my knowledge to make an impact.  Currently, my main
                                focus is bridging the gap between business and technology.  Like I did in my rowing 
                                career, I want to work hard every single day, build relationships, and win.

                                    worked with a partner to create a middle layer of a database - inputs were 
                                    users' queries, and outputs were tuples, stats, or other information that had 
                                    been requested.  To process information concurrently, we used promises.  We also 
                                    used REST endpoints to separate client and server.  In order to efficiently 
                                    transform, locate, and retrieve data, we used hash functions.  Testing was done 
                                    with Mocha and Chai.  Collaboration was done using GitHub.  My partner and I

                                    Completed as the final project for my Software Construction (CPSC 210) class.  
                                    The project was to create an Android app in Java that provided bus route 
                                    information around Vancouver.  I used TransLink's Open API to retrieve bus 
                                    route, stop, and schedule information, and built JSON parsers to interpret that 
                                    data.  By using the singleton design pattern, I was able to ensure that bus 
                                    stops and routes were accessible throughout the entire application.  When 
                                    clicking on a bus stop, users were shown bus routes overlaid on the map.  If 
                                    they wanted more information, they could click a button to get real-time 
                                    information on arrival times and delays.  Testing was done with JUnit and I 
                                    simulated the app's display using Genymotion.  I received a grade of 100% on the 
                                    project.

                                    I was inspired to create this project after learning about the method of loci, 
                                    which is a memory technique that uses visualization as a memory aid.  The method 
                                    of loci involves a user creating a "mind palace" - a route of a real-world 
                                    location that they are familiar with.  The idea behind the project was to 
                                    simplify the process of committing a mind palace to memory.  Users take pictures 
                                    that serve as the points on the route.  Along that route, users can insert 
                                    visual cues to help them remember something, from grocery lists to key points in 
                                    a presentation.  I decided to try to create a sense of augmented reality through 
                                    the use of emojis and functionality heavily inspired by Snapchat's stickers.

                                    a good metaphor for eliminating possible options one at a time by comparing two

                                My rowing story began in <a class="rowingShowPic" onclick="showPic(1)">grade 
                                eight</a>.  I had just started high school at Vancouver College and joined the team 
                                mostly to make friends.  That decision turned out to be one of the best decisions I 
                                have ever made, and it changed my life forever.  <br><br>

                                Through rowing, I learned to work hard.  I also learned how to be a good teammate.  
                                Rowing is unique in its team structure, since each person in the boat must perform 
                                the same precise motions in unison, and a mistake from one rower can affect the 
                                entire crew.  There is no help defense or deep safety to cover up mistakes.  
                                Everyone is responsible for themselves, and there needs to be a tremendous amount 
                                of trust between teammates.  <br><br>

                                In grade ten, I went to nationals in Ontario for the first time and won the 
                                heavyweight 4+ event.  As sweet as 
                                <a class="rowingShowPic" onclick="showPic(2)">becoming a national champion</a> was, 
                                I learned more from my disappointing fourth place finish in my other race.  I 
                                started to work even harder, with extra workout sessions, eating better, and taking 
                                better care of my body through stretching and physio.  It paid off the following 
                                year, when I won another national championship, this time on the senior level.

                                nationals the next year, I came to UBC.  It was a totally different league.  I had 
                                been in the varsity boat for my entire high school experience, and I was relegated 
                                to the JV boat for the first time in my life.  It was a wakeup call.  I took my 
                                training to an even higher level and was able to make the varsity lightweight 4+ in 
                                my second year, culminating in a second place finish at nationals.  The drive to 
                                win the gold medal motivated me through the rest of my rowing career.  <br><br>

                                The summer after my fourth year, I got the opportunity to compete in the

                                in China.  Both races were watched by thousands of people and featured some of the 
                                best rowing schools in the world - Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge, Sidney, Brookes, the 
                                University of Washington, and others.  My crew placed second at Windermere and 
                                first in China. <br><br>

                                I took on more of a leadership role in my fifth year.  As the oldest and most 
                                experienced rower in the lightweight 4+, I was voted captain.  I had an 
                                inexperienced crew and knew that we needed to put in extra effort to beat Queens, 
                                who had two members of the national team in their boat.  We took extra training 
                                camps in Bellingham on top of our already rigorous schedule.  It was because of our 
                                teamwork and trust in one another that we were able to have the race of our lives.  
                                We were able to overcome Queens to win the <a class="rowingShowPic"

                                I've learned a lot over the past ten years.  Leaving the sport will be a difficult 
                                transition, but I'm looking forward to what comes next for me.  The friends that I 
                                have made and the life skills that I have gained will be with me forever, and I 
                                will never forget the how it felt to cross the finish line with my brothers for the 
                                last time.

                                Going into university, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do yet.  I chose to study 
                                commerce, since I felt that having business knowledge would be useful no matter 
                                where I chose to go in my career.  I was mostly uninspired by marketing, 
                                accounting, and many other common majors. <br><br>

                                In my second year, though, I took a class called Management Information Systems.  
                                It changed my life.  I learned very basic coding, and I was hooked.  After that, I 
                                knew that I wanted to go into a field where I could combine my business knowledge 
                                with technology.  I chose to major in Business and Computer Science, a combined 
                                major at UBC. <br><br>

                                I was inspired by learning the kinds of solutions that technology provides - 
                                creating systems to complete tasks that no human could achieve alone is where I 
                                have found my passion.

                                    My journey as a fan
                                </h4>

                            </div>


                            <p>
                                I got back into basketball in 2011.  Though I didn't play it because of my rowing 
                                commitments, I became an NBA fan.  When it came time for me to choose a team, I 
                                chose the Cleveland Cavaliers. <br><br>

                                I enjoy watching basketball because each team has a unique style.  The diversity of 
                                the Spurs' offense looks completely different from the analytic-driven 3s and 
                                layups philosophy of the Warriors and Rockets.  The style that appealed the most to 
                                me was the Cavaliers' clear division of roles among its players - on every 
                                possession, it was one player's job to probe the defense, while others would cut, 
                                screen, provide spacing from the 3 point line, or prepare to get an offensive 
                                rebound.  Dividing these responsibilities made each player's job simpler, and the 
                                team benefitted overall.  <br><br>

                                The struggles and 20-win seasons in my early days as a fan only made the 2016 
                                championship that much sweeter.  The Cavs had been down three games to one, and no 
                                one expected them to have a chance.  No team had ever come back from a 3-1 defecit 
                                in the NBA Finals.  They fought every game and were able to force a seventh game.  
                                After trailing in the second half, they tied the game at 89.  No one could score 
                                for what felt like an eternity until Kyrie Irving hit an unbelievable shot, 
                                completing the comeback.  Never giving up and believing in myself even when no one 
                                else does are things that I try to replicate in my own life.
                            </p>
