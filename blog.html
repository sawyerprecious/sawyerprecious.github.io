                            </h1>
                            <h8> November 7, 2020 </h8>
                            <p>
                                I was in Atlanta for a conference a while ago, when travelling for conferences
                                was a thing.  One of the memories that stuck with me the most from that trip was
                                the security guards working at the conference centre.  They were overwhelmingly
                                black, overwhelmingly women, and overwhelmingly older.  I talked to a lot of them
                                over the course of my week there, and Biden's win this morning has me thinking a
                                lot about those conversations.
                                <br/><br/>
                                I remember one guy who was in his 70s and couldn't retire because he didn't have the
                                money.  On the day I talked to him, he was working overtime.  He had been working 12
                                hours a day or more that entire week.  While he was sitting next to me, he kept 
                                drifting in and out of sleep, and eventually had to leave his post to find somewhere
                                to lie down.
                                <br/><br/>
                                There was a woman who had moved there from New York a couple years ago to take care
                                of her sick sister.  She had worked in broadcasting for decades but couldn't find a
                                job when she moved.  She had to take a minimum wage job working security instead.
                                <br/><br/>
                                These people work hard.  They are trying as hard as they can to find financial
                                stability.  They're incredibly entrepreneurial.  One woman was spending hundreds of
                                dollars on real estate courses to try to become a realtor.  One had started a
                                podcast.  One was a travel agent on the side.  All of them were putting a ton of
                                time and effort into their side gigs and none of them were making any money from
                                them.
                                <br/><br/>
                                I kept hearing the same message â€“ opportunities do not exist for poor people in
                                Atlanta.  Trump claimed that the economy was great over the past four years.  It was
                                not.  It was great for people like me who can put money into the stock market, who
                                come from money, who are overwhelmingly white, and who are overwhelmingly male.
                                There are millions of people who don't look like me who will never have the
                                opportunities that I have had.
                                <br/><br/>
                                I knew that systemic racism existed before I went to the South, but I had never seen
                                it so naked and in the open.  The people working on the tech for the conference were 
                                white.  The security guards and janitors were black.  People who looked like me were
                                making 6 figures.  People who did not look like me were making 6 dollars an hour.
                                <br/><br/>
                                As Biden wins Georgia, I'm thinking about the people I met in Atlanta.  These are
                                huge issues, and they can't change overnight.  With that said, they helped affect 
                                change tonight.  I hope that they have a little bit more hope right now than they
                                did when I talked to them eight months ago.
